This is the on-boarding curriculum for new Instructor Trainers. This material supports 8 1-hour discussion meetings based on assigned reading from our textbook, [How Learning Works by Ambrose et al.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-learning-works-seven-research-based-principles-for-smart-teaching/oclc/468969206), as well as our Instructor Training Curriculum. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This curriculum targets individuals who have applied and been accepted as Carpentry Instructor Trainers. It is generally expected that learners either have extensive background in teaching or have demonstrated commitment to Carpentries teaching practices through involvement with the community. However, no particular background knowledge is necessary to participate fully in these discussions.
