## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Appendix D: What are Learning Objectives and How Can We Use Them?
2\. One of the learning objectives stated in the Instructor Training curriculum is: "Critically analyze a learning objective for your workshop." What level of 
Bloom's taxonomy does this objective fall under? Examining the chart on p. 246, try re-writing this learning objective at a lower level and a higher level. Do you 
this objective is at an appropriate level for Instructor trainees? Why or why not?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
3\. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good opportunities for practice. In the context of a technical workshop, what role can an Instructor play in 
this regard? A helper?

4\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a technical workshop get feedback on their progress? Is that feedback likely to meet the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? Why or why not?

5\. In all workshops (Instructor Training and technical) Carpentries surveys provide feedback from learners, and additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. minute cards 
and one-up-one-down) supplement this for a rich source of information. Do you think there is any additional advantage in asking a co-Instructor or co-Trainer for 
feedback? Why or why not? If so, how would you go about seeking such feedback?
