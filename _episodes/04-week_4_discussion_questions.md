- Chapter 5

## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
5\. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good opportunities for practice. How does this apply in a technical workshop setting? What role does/can an Instructor play in this regard? A helper?

6\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a computational workshop get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not) the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? 

7\. How do you expect practice and feedback to contribute to your skill development as a Trainer? What will you need to do to facilitate this?
