## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

2\. Take a moment with Figure 3.2 (p.80). Can you think of an situation you've encountered in a classroom that is explained 
by this figure?

3\. Do you think learners at Carpentries technical workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? How about at Instructor Training workshops?

4\. This chapter offers a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies (p.83-89). Which are most relevant to Carpentries workshops? Are any of them **not** relevant in this setting? Why or why not?

#### Chapter 4: How Do Students Develop Mastery?
5\. This chapter discusses expert "blind spots" (now re-named in our curriculum as ["expert awareness gaps"](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/03-expertise/index.html#expert-awareness-gap)) and cognitive load. 
How might these affect learners during an Instructor Training workshop? How about Trainers?

6\. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. 
How can we help learners bridge the gap between learning and application? Is this different for Instructor Training vs technical Carpentries workshops?
