# Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 6
## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you this week?

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 6: Why do Student Development and Course Climate Matter for Learning?
2. What do you think are the most important things for new Carpentry instructors to know about course climate and student development? How do the principles discussed in this chapter come into play in our workshop environment?

3. Which of the strategies suggested on pages 180-186 are applicable to our workshops? How can we help instructors implement them?

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [The Carpentries: Workshop Introductions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/19-introductions/)
4. This section includes a LOT of things that can be included in a good introduction. It is probably a good idea to give our instructors some guidance on how to use this information, and where to begin. How would you distill this message in a recap or summary of this lesson? What are the most important elements to convey?

#### [Code of Conduct](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/conduct/)
5. Code of Conduct issues donâ€™t come up often at workshops, but when they do it can be difficult to know how to react. What do we want to communicate with our instructors about communicating the CoC and enforcing it?
