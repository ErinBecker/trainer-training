## Hypothes.is: 
1\. Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.

## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [How Learning Works: Working Memory and Cognitive Load](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/)
2\. This episode provides reasons why we go slowly and allow emphasize practice. However, instructors are often faced with the urge to go faster or cover more. How can we help instructors understand the importance of keeping it slow and resisting the urge to “cover” more material?

3\. Look at one page from a Software or Data Carpentry lesson. What pre-knowledge is absolutely required to learn the content? 
Is there anything extraneous? Anything missing? How effectively does this lesson manage the learners’ cognitive load?

4\. Where are places in our (computational) curriculum where we make connections among concepts and facts explicit? Where are places where we could be more explicit?

5\. Where are places in our (computational) curriculum where we help learners develop the ability to use fluid representations of the material 
taught? Where are places where we could do this better?

#### [Building Teaching Skill: Getting Feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/)

6\. How can we model good use of feedback in the context of instructor training?

#### [Creating a Positive Learning Environment: Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/)

7\. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are lots of things an instructor could do to accidentally demotivate learners. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?


#### [Creating a Positive Learning Environment: Mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/)
8\.  Take the “mindset self assessment” linked from the “What’s your Mindset?” activity. What do you think about this activity? How do you think different learners might respond to it? How might you address those responses?

9\. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to a learner’s process of becoming a better teacher?
