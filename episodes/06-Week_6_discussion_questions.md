## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
2\. What stands out or interests you from this weekâ€™s reading? You may type your own response but also feel free to paste a snippet from the curriculum itself or from any of the comments/questions/replies in Hypothes.is.

#### [Building Skill With Feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/index.html)
3\. We generally do a good job of modeling the collection of feedback in an instructor training workshop. How can we also model good *use* of feedback in this context?

#### [Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html)
4\. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are many demotivating "traps" an 
instructor can fall into even when they're aware of the problem. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering 
from these slip-ups?

#### [Mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/index.html)
5\. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to the process of learning to becoming a better teacher?

#### [Teaching is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html)
6\. This lesson is mostly practice and feedback. What instructional strategies do you think will help them to get the most out of this experience?

#### [Live Coding is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/index.html)
7\. How does practice of participatory live coding relate to concepts we have learned about cognition, memory, and motivation?
