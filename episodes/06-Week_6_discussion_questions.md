## Hypothes.is: 
1\. Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.

## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [How Learning Works: Working Memory and Cognitive Load](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html)
2\. This episode provides reasons why we go slowly and allow emphasize practice. However, instructors are often faced with the urge to go faster or cover more. How can we help instructors remember to keep it slow and resist the urge to “cover” more material?

3\. The concept mapping example in this exercise is often difficult for Trainers and learners to navigate. Can you construct an alternative example that is more accessible to novices but still has some relevance to our curriculum?

4\. Non-programming learners who are taking Instructor Training are often directed to study the [OpenRefine lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/). What could you direct these learners to do during the section on faded examples?

#### [Building Teaching Skill: Getting Feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/index.html)

6\. We generally do a good job of modeling the collection of feedback in an instructor training workshop. How can we also model good use of feedback in this context?

#### [Creating a Positive Learning Environment: Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html)

7\. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are lots of things an instructor could do to accidentally demotivate learners. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?


#### [Creating a Positive Learning Environment: Mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/index.html)
8\. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to the process of learning to becoming a better teacher?

9\. This lesson discusses praise. Have you ever received praise that was well-intended but felt insulting or demotivating or just inexplicably wrong? Why do you think that was?
