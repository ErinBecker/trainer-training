Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 7
Discussion Questions

Hypothes.is homework: please add comments/responses to both curriculum pages assigned this week.

“How Learning Works”
Chapter 7: How do Students Become Self-directed Learners?

1 How do we help learners scaffold their metacognitive practices? In what ways do we already do this well and how can we improve? 

2 How does mindset apply to metacognition? Does this chapter give us any new tools for helping learners to adjust away from a fixed mindset?

Instructor Training Curriculum
The Carpentries: How We Operate http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-carpentries/ 

3 Do you have any questions about policies and procedures for running a workshop? What do you think might be unclear to instructors reading these materials?

4 We have a brand new activity for this unit (just merged this week)! Have a look at the “What’s our Role” activity and see what you think!
