# Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 7

## Hypothes.is homework
1. Please add comments/responses to both curriculum pages assigned this week.

## Discussion Questions
### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 7: How do Students Become Self-directed Learners?

1. How do we help learners scaffold their metacognitive practices? In what ways do we already do this well and how can we improve? 

2. How does mindset apply to metacognition? Does this chapter give us any new tools for helping learners to adjust away from a fixed mindset?

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [The Carpentries: How We Operate](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-carpentries/)

3. Do you have any questions about policies and procedures for running a workshop? What do you think might be unclear to instructors reading these materials?

4. Have a look at the “What’s our Role” activity. This is a newer activity -- what do you think?

#### [The Carpentries: Teaching Practices](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/22-practices/) 

5 We will do the [worksheet activity](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Carpentries_teaching_practices.pdf) in groups during our discussion. Please have a look at this worksheet ahead of time and think about how you would fill it out.
