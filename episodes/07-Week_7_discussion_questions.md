## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you this week? What do you want to be sure we cover today?

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [Building Teaching Skill: The Importance of Practice](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/)
2\. The majority of this lesson consists of practice and feedback in various ways. Apart from those experiences, can you identify two key points that you would like to get across to learners during this lesson?

#### [Building Teaching Skill: Lesson Study](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-lesson-study/)
3\. This module addresses some new points and also some points that we began to discuss in previous lessons. How does the discussion of “challenge” exercises fit here in the context of lesson study? Does this (new, in parts) module meet its stated objectives?

#### [Building Teaching Skill: Live Coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/)
4\. How does the Carpentry practice of live coding relate to the discussion in this chapter of practice and feedback?

#### [The Carpentries: Workshop Introductions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/19-introductions/)
5\. This section includes a LOT of things that can be included in a good introduction. It is probably a good idea to give our instructors some guidance on how to use this information, and where to begin. How would you distill this message in a recap or summary of this lesson? What are the most important elements to convey?
