## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
2\.What stands out or interests you from this weekâ€™s reading? You may type your own response but also feel free to paste a snippet from the curriculum itself or from any of the comments/questions/replies in Hypothes.is.

#### [Preparing to Teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
3\. Identify one concept from this lesson that you think might be challenging to communicate. What makes it difficult? How might you work through it when teaching?

#### [Managing a Diverse Classroom](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/index.html)
4\. The prospect of responding to a Code of Conduct violation is frightening, but we want Instructors to feel empowered to act and report if an incident occurs. This confidence starts with their Trainers. How do *you* feel about the prospect of handling an incident at a workshop? What questions do you have? What questions do you worry you won't be able to answer? 

#### [Checkout Process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-checkout/index.html) 
5\. Not all trainees are interested in completing checkout for certification. We're ok with that! What we worry about is 
when trainees who *do* want to certify are intimidated or deterred by some part of the process. What role can a Trainer play 
in supporting or encouraging trainees who want to complete the checkout process?

6\. What advice might you give to instructors to help them "play to their own strengths and weaknesses"?
