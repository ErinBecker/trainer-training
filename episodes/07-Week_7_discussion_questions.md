## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
2\. (Please do not skip) What stands out or interests you from this weekâ€™s reading? You may type your own response but also feel free to paste a snippet from the curriculum itself or from any of the comments/questions/replies in Hypothes.is.

#### [Building Skill With Feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/index.html)
3\. We generally do a good job of modeling the collection of feedback in an instructor training workshop. There are also opportunities for us to model good *use* of feedback. How might you accomplish this? In what ways might this be helpful for participants to see?

#### [Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html)
4\. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are many demotivating "traps" an 
instructor can fall into even when they are aware of the problem. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering 
from these slip-ups?

#### [Mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/index.html)
5\. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to the process of learning to becoming a better teacher?

#### [Teaching is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html)
6\. This lesson is mostly practice and feedback. What instructional strategies do you think will help them to get the most out of this experience?

#### [Live Coding is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/index.html)
7\. Draw a concept map that connects participatory live coding (or some aspects thereof) with one or more concepts related to memory, cognition, or motivation.
