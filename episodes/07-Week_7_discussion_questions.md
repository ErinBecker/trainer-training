## Hypothes.is: 
1\. (Optional) Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.

## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [Teaching is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html)
2\. The majority of this lesson consists of practice and feedback in various ways. Apart from those experiences, can you identify two key points that you would like to get across to learners during this lesson?

#### [Live Coding is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/index.html)
3\. How does practice of participatory live coding relate to concepts we have learned about cognition, memory, and motivation?

#### [Preparing to Teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
4\. Identify one concept from this lesson that you think might be challenging to communicate. Compose a short sentence to explain that concept (or some part of it) in your own words.

#### [Managing a Diverse Classroom](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/index.html)
5\. Most people never feel fully confident about their ability to manage a potential Code of Conduct violation. It is important that instructors have at least enough confidence in our process that they feel empowered to act and report if an incident occurs. Helping learners to gain this confidence begins with building on your own! How confident do you feel that *you* could manage an incident at a workshop? What questions do you have? What fears or doubts? 

#### [Workshop Introductions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/23-introductions/index.html)
6\. This section includes a LOT of things that can be included in a good introduction. It is probably a good idea to give our instructors some guidance on where to begin. How would you distill this message in a recap or summary of this lesson? What are the most important elements to convey?
