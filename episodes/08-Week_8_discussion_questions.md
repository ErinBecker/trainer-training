# Trainer Training Book Club Week 8

## Hypothes.is:
Please add comments to all modules covered today.

## Reading:
_How Learning Works_: Conclusion
Episodes 20-23: 
Review Trainer Guide


## Other homework:
1. Diagram the instructor training curriculum! Call it a concept map if it helps you; otherwise call it whatever you want. Use your choice of tools -- draw.io is handy; so is a pencil and paper (though you may want to take a picture of your drawing to share).

## Discussion Questions

1\. What are the component skills of teaching? Are all of these skills addressed in our curriculum and/or represented in your diagram? Is anything missing?

### _How Learning Works_

#### Conclusion p. 217-224

2\. What advice might you give to instructors to help them “play to their own strengths and weaknesses”? How might you advise instructors who identify as ‘introverts’ vs ‘extroverts’?

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [The Carpentries: How We Operate](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-carpentries/)

3\. Do you have any questions about policies and procedures for running a workshop? What do you think might be unclear to instructors reading these materials?

4\. Have a look at the “What’s our Role” activity. This is a newer activity -- what do you think?

#### [The Carpentries: Teaching Practices](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/22-practices/) 

5\. We will do the [worksheet activity](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/handouts/Carpentries_teaching_practices.pdf) in groups during our discussion. Please have a look at this worksheet ahead of time and think about how you would fill it out.
