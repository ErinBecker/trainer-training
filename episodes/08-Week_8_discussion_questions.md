keypoints:  
- "Thinking critically about Bloom's Taxonomy is typically beyond the Blooms' level we can expect Instructor trainees to perform at. Examine *your* learning objectives carefully to calibrate your expectations for this episode and meet learners where they are."
- "Instructors are unlikely to face a Code of Conduct violation, but need to know what to do if this occurs. Reassurance of team support and clear instructions on reporting are the most important elements to communicate."
- "Trainees may be intimidated by many elements of checkout. It is important to emphasize that teaching demonstrations are a friendly opportunity to give and receive feedback, not a high-stakes test, and that our Core Team is there to support them with any questions they may have during the checkout process." 
- "New Instructors should start their improvement process with "low hanging fruit" -- teaching techniques they can easily adopt. For some, this might center on presentation style; for others, it might have more to do with classroom mechanics. Focusing on one thing at a time to improve on can help people evaluate and prioritize their goals as they progress."

## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
2\. What stands out or interests you from this weekâ€™s reading? You may type your own response but also feel free to paste a snippet from the curriculum itself or from any of the comments/questions/replies in Hypothes.is.

#### [Preparing to Teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
3\. Identify one concept from this lesson that you think might be challenging to communicate. What makes it difficult? How might you work through it when teaching?

#### [Managing a Diverse Classroom](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/index.html)
4\. The prospect of responding to a Code of Conduct violation is frightening, but we want Instructors to feel empowered to act and report if an incident occurs. This confidence starts with their Trainers. How do *you* feel about the prospect of handling an incident at a workshop? What questions do you have? What questions do you worry you won't be able to answer? 

#### [Checkout Process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-checkout/index.html) 
5\. Not all trainees are interested in completing checkout for certification. We're ok with that! What we worry about is 
when trainees who *do* want to certify are intimidated or deterred by some part of the process. What role can a Trainer play 
in supporting or encouraging trainees who want to complete the checkout process?
