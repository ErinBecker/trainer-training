# Trainer Training Book Club Week 8

## Hypothes.is homework:
1. Review some parts of the curriculum you haven’t visited in a while. Add comments and/or responses as appropriate.

## Other homework:
1. Diagram the instructor training curriculum! Call it a concept map if it helps you; otherwise call it whatever you want. Use your choice of tools -- draw.io is handy; so is a pencil and paper (though you may want to take a picture of your drawing to share).

## Discussion Questions

1. What are the component skills of teaching? Are all of these skills addressed in our curriculum and/or represented in your diagram? Is anything missing?

### _How Learning Works_

#### Conclusion p. 217-224

2. What advice might you give to instructors to help them “play to their own strengths and weaknesses”? How might you advise instructors who identify as ‘introverts’ vs ‘extroverts’?
