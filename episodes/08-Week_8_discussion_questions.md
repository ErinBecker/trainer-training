Trainer Training Book Club Week 8

Hypothes.is homework:
Review some parts of the curriculum you haven’t visited in a while. Add comments and/or responses as appropriate.

Other homework:
Diagram the instructor training curriculum! Call it a concept map if it helps you; otherwise call it whatever you want. Use your choice of tools -- draw.io is handy; so is a pencil and paper (though you may want to take a picture of your drawing to share).

For anyone willing to share their diagram with the broader community of instructors and trainers, I’d be delighted to send these around or make them available on GitHub. If you’d like to share, you may want to figure that audience in when constructing your diagram. You will have time to revise after our meeting if you would like to do that, also.


Discussion Questions

1 What are the component skills of teaching? Are all of these skills addressed in our curriculum and/or represented in your diagram? Is anything missing?

How Learning Works: Conclusion p. 217-224

2 What advice might you give to instructors to help them “play to their own strengths and weaknesses”? How might you advise instructors who identify as ‘introverts’ vs ‘extroverts’?
