## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Appendix D: What are Learning Objectives and How Can We Use Them?
2\. Examining the chart on p. 246, imagine a topic or task you might teach learners to perform during a technical workshop. Try sketching out related learning objectives at 
each Blooms level using words in the chart. Take care to focus on the level of *cognition* required, not the *point in the 
workflow* at which you are asking learners to operate (e.g. tasks can be simplified even at advanced analytical stages of a workflow, and even starter tasks can be 
used for a cognitive challenge). Which of your objectives are clearly inter-dependent? Which could feasibly be taught in a 2-day workshop?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
3\. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good opportunities for practice. In the context of a technical workshop, what role can an Instructor play in this regard? A helper?

4\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a technical workshop get feedback on their progress? Is that feedback likely to meet the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? Why or why not?

5\. Do you think feedback from a co-Instructor or co-Trainer would likely differ from feedback received from learners through minute cards or surveys? Why or why not?
