## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week's reading?

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 6: Why do Student Development and Course Climate Matter for Learning?
2\. While this chapter views "culture" through a developmental lens, most of the topics covered here also relate to adults. How might these factors relate to:
* the Code of Conduct
* Motivation (try to be specific!)
* Cognition & memory

3\. Which of the strategies suggested on pages 180-186 are most applicable to Carpentries workshops? In what ways might new instructors need support or guidance in implementing these?

#### Chapter 7: How do Students Become Self-directed Learners?

4\. Most of our learners have experience with metacognitive strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our workshops (content or Instructor Training). Why do you think this is? How can we support our learners in transferring these skills appropriately? 

5\. **Please have some plain paper and a dark-colored marker handy during discussion in case we get to work on this question.** Try making a concept map that outlines ways in which metacognition is (or can be) supported during a workshop, referencing one or more of the strategies listed on p.203-215. What did you learn from this process?
