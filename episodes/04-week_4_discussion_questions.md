## Reading
*How Learning Works*: 
- Appendix D
- Chapter 5

## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Appendix D: What are Learning Objectives and How Can We Use Them?
2\. Use the chart on p. 246 to examine some learning objectives from Carpentries workshops (technical and/or Instructor 
Training). In what categories of Bloom's Taxonomy do these fall? Do they seem appropriate to the level of the learners? Do 
they seem adequate, as workshop outcomes?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
3\. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good opportunities for practice. How does this apply in a technical workshop setting? What role does/can an Instructor play in this regard? A helper?

4\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a computational workshop get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not) the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? 

5\. How do you expect practice and feedback to contribute to your skill development as a Trainer? What will you need to do to facilitate this?
