Discussion Questions

Hypothes.is homework: 
Please write at least one comment on the Lesson Study module, and reply to at least one comment on one of the previous week’s modules.

1 What stood out to you this week? Memorable content, concerns, questions, or anecdotes go here. 

Extension from Week 4:
2 What is most important for our instructors to understand about mindset? If we consider mindset to exist on a spectrum, and also to vary greatly between contexts, at what point or where might a “fixed mindset” prevent an instructor from teaching effectively? What (if anything) can we do about that?

Week 5 reading: 

“How Learning Works”
Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
3 This chapter discusses the importance of setting good opportunities for practice. What aspects are important to consider when creating practice opportunities? Look at an example or two from one of our (content) workshop curricula - how well do you think we do on this?
4 Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. How do learners in our content workshops get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not meet) the criteria for useful feedback outlined in this chapter?

Instructor Training Curriculum
Live Coding
5 How does the Carpentry practice of live coding relate to the discussion in this chapter of practice and feedback?

Lesson Study
6 This module addresses some new points and also some points that we began to discuss in previous lessons. How does the discussion of “challenge” exercises fit here in the context of lesson study? Does this (new, in parts) module meet its stated objectives?
