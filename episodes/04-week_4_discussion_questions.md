#Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 4

## Hypothes.is assignment: 
1. Reply to one comment that was made last week on the Motivation lesson (http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/ )
2. Write (at least) one comment on the Mindset lesson (http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/ )

## Discussion Questions
### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 4: How Do Students Develop Mastery?
1. This chapter discusses expert blind spots and cognitive load. We teach about these in the training curriculum, but how might we effectively manage them when teaching this class? Are there any specific points at which you think trainer expertise or cognitive overload pose a particular risk during an instructor training event? 

2. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. How do we help our learners bridge the gap between learning and application? In other words, how do we “teach to facilitate transfer”? How do we do this for our instructors?

### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [Building Teaching Skill: The Importance of Practice](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/)
3. The majority of this lesson consists of practice and feedback in various ways. Apart from those experiences, can you identify two key points that you would like to get across to learners during this lesson?

#### [Creating a positive learning environment: mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/)
4.  Take the “mindset self assessment” linked from the “What’s your Mindset?” activity. What do you think about this activity? How do you think different learners might respond to it? How might you address those responses?

5. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to a learner’s process of becoming a better teacher?
