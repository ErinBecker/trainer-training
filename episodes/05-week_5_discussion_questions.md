## Hypothes.is: 
1\. Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.

2\.  This module includes an activity for assessing trainee’s background. What information might this give us related to trainee’s prior knowledge? How could we use this information to adjust our teaching?

3\.  Identify one thing each that you’re a novice for, a competent practitioner for and an expert at. Be explicit about why you categorize yourself that way. What would need to be different about your abilities and/or knowledge in order to categorize yourself at a different level for that skill?
    
4\.  We’ll talk more about mental models next week in connection with Chapter 2.
    
5\.  We teach our instructors how to write good MCQs, faded examples and Parson’s problems, but most of the time we don’t use these in workshops. What sorts of formative assessments do we use instead and why? Why do you think these other types of assessment are included in the curriculum?

6\. This episode includes material about dismissive language. This is a common issue for instructors, 
new or experienced. What other examples can you give of dismissive language and how can we help our instructors avoid them?
