## Reading
_How Learning Works_ Chapter 6, Chapter 7
### Introduction to Hypothes.is
Please visit [https://web.hypothes.is/](https://web.hypothes.is/)

Try playing with this tool, and report back with any questions or problems. We will begin using it next week.

## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 6: Why do Student Development and Course Climate Matter for Learning?
2\. While this chapter views "culture" through a developmental lens, most of these topics also relate to adults. How might concepts presented in this chapter apply to:
* the Code of Conduct
* Motivation 
* Cognition & memory

3\. Choose a strategy among those suggested on pages 180-186 that seems applicable to a Carpentries technical workshop. Would a new Instructor likely feel comfortable implementing this strategy? How might we support or encourage them in applying it?

#### Chapter 7: How do Students Become Self-directed Learners?

4\. Most of our learners have rich experience with metacognitive strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our workshops (technical or Instructor Training). Why do you think this is? How can we support our learners in transferring these skills appropriately? 

5\. (Try not to skip this question.) Try making a concept map that outlines ways in which metacognition is (or can be) supported during a workshop. Can you draw a connection to one or more of the strategies listed on p.203-215? What did you learn from this process?
