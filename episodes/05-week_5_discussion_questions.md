## Hypothes.is: 
1\. Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.

2\. This module includes an activity for assessing trainee’s background. Are these questions useful?
- If so, how might you use them to adjust your instruction in the subsequent modules?
- If not, can you think of a (quick, multiple choice) alternative or additional question that you would like to ask?

3\. It can be useful to prepare personal examples for some topics. Identify one thing each that you’re a novice for, a competent practitioner for and an expert at. How would you explain the way you have categorized these skills?

4\. Try creating a concept map that in some way addresses both skill acquisition and mental models. Would formative assessment fit naturally on your map as well? Add that too if it doesn't make it too cluttered to share!
    
5\. We introduce skill acquisition in this module, but really dig into expertise in the next. What is the purpose of introducing skill acquisition here? What should be emphasized here, vs in the next section?

6\. Dismissive language can occur as a result of negligence, but it can also happen as a result of good intentions.
Instructors are often surprised to be told that telling learners that a task is "easy" is dismissive.
How would you help someone who wants to convey to learners that a task is *achievable* to find a way to convey that message in a more motivating way?
