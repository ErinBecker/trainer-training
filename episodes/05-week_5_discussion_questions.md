3\. This module includes an activity for assessing your trainees' backgrounds. 
- How might you use them to adjust your instruction in the subsequent modules?
- Can you think of a (quick, multiple choice) alternative or additional question that you would like to ask?

4\. It can be useful to prepare personal examples for some topics. Identify one thing each that you're a novice for, a competent practitioner for and an expert at. How would you explain the way you have categorized these skills?

5\. Try creating a concept map that relates the following 3 concepts: 
- skill acquisition
- mental models
- formative assessment
    
6\. We introduce skill acquisition in this module, but really dig into expertise in the next. What is the purpose of introducing skill acquisition here? What should be emphasized here, vs in the next section?

7\. Dismissive language can occur as a result of negligence, but it can also happen as a result of good intentions.
Trainees are often surprised to be told that telling learners that a task is "easy" is dismissive.
How would you help someone who wants to convey to learners that a task is *achievable* to find a way to convey that message in a more motivating way?
