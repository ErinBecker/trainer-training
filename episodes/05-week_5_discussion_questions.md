## Reading
_How Learning Works_ Chapter 6, Chapter 7
### Introduction to Hypothes.is
Please visit [https://web.hypothes.is/](https://web.hypothes.is/)

Try playing with this tool, and report back with any questions or problems. We will begin using it next week.

## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 6: Why do Student Development and Course Climate Matter for Learning?
2\. How might The Carpentries Code of Conduct function in supporting an "explicitly centralizing"(p.171-172) classroom climate? 

3\. Choose a strategy among those suggested on pages 180-186 that seems useful or essential to a Carpentries technical workshop. What factors might prevent an Instructor from effectively implementing this strategy? As a Trainer, how might you help?

#### Chapter 7: How do Students Become Self-directed Learners?

4\. Most of our learners have rich experience with metacognitive strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our workshops (technical or Instructor Training). Why do you think this is? How can we support our learners in transferring metacognitive skills appropriately? 

5\. (Try not to skip this question.) Try making a concept map that links one or more of the strategies on p.203-215 to one or more practices that could be implemented in a workshop to support metacognition. What concepts did you connect? What relationships did you identify?
