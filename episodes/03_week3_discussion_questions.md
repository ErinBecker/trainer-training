## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 4: How Do Students Develop Mastery?
2\. This chapter discusses expert "blind spots" (now re-named in our curriculum as ["expert awareness gaps"](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/03-expertise/index.html#expert-awareness-gap)) and cognitive load. 
How might these affect learners during an Instructor Training workshop? How about Trainers?

3\. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. 
How can we help learners bridge the gap between learning and application? Is this different for Instructor Training vs technical Carpentries workshops?

#### Appendix D: What are Learning Objectives and How Can We Use Them?
4\. Use the chart on p. 246 to examine some learning objectives from Carpentries workshops (technical and/or Instructor 
Training). In what categories of Bloom's Taxonomy do these fall? Do they seem appropriate to the level of the learners? Do 
they seem adequate, as workshop outcomes?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
5\. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good opportunities for practice. How does this apply in a technical workshop setting? What role does/can an Instructor play in this regard? A helper?

6\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a computational workshop get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not) the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? 

7\. How do you expect practice and feedback to contribute to your skill development as a Trainer? What will you need to do to facilitate this?
