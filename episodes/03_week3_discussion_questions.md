*How Learning Works*: Chapter 4, Appendix D, Chapter 5

## Discussion Questions
1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 4: How Do Students Develop Mastery?
2\. This chapter discusses expert blind spots and cognitive load. How might we effectively manage these when teaching an instructor training workshop? Are there any specific ways in which you think Trainer expertise or cognitive overload pose a particular risk during an instructor training event? 

3\. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. How do we help learners bridge the gap between learning and application? In other words, how do we “teach to facilitate transfer”? Is this different for instructor training vs other Carpentries workshops?

#### Appendix D: What are Learning Objectives and How Can We Use Them?
4\. Use the chart on p. 246 to examine some learning objectives from Carpentries workshops (computational and/or instructor training). In what categories of Bloom's Taxonomy do these fall? Do they seem appropriate to the level of the learners? Do they seem sufficient, as workshop outcomes?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
5\. This chapter discusses the importance of setting good opportunities for practice. How does this apply in a workshop setting? What role does/can an instructor play in this regard? A helper?

6\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a computational workshop get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not) the criteria for *useful* feedback outlined in this chapter? 

7\. How do you expect practice and feedback to contribute to your skill development as a Trainer? What will you need to do to facilitate this? What can the Carpentries do to support this?
