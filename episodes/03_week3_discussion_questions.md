# Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 3
##Discussion Questions

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

1. This chapter has a lot of jargon. How would you summarize the main take away points in a sentence or two in a way that non-experts could understand?
2. Do you think learners at our workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? Will they primarily be placing an attainment value, intrinsic value or instrumental value on learning the material? Is this also true of trainees at instructor training workshops?
3. Pages 83-89 offer a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies. Pick one (or more) of these and explain how it is relevant to our workshop model? Are any of them not relevant in our workshops? Why not?

### _Instructor Training Curriculum_
#### [Building Teaching Skill: Getting Feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/)
#### [Creating a Positive Learning Environment: Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/)

4. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are lots of things an instructor could do to accidentally demotivate learners. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?
