## Discussion Questions

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 4: How Do Students Develop Mastery?
1\. This chapter discusses expert blind spots and cognitive load. We teach about these in the training curriculum, but how might we effectively manage them when teaching this class? Are there any specific points at which you think trainer expertise or cognitive overload pose a particular risk during an instructor training event? 

2\. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. How do we help our learners bridge the gap between learning and application? In other words, how do we “teach to facilitate transfer”? How do we do this for our instructors?

#### Chapter 5: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
3\. This chapter discusses the importance of setting good opportunities for practice. What aspects are important to consider when creating practice opportunities? Look at an example or two from one of our (computational) workshop curricula - how well do you think we do on this?

4\. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. How do learners in our computational workshops get feedback on their progress? How does that feedback meet (or not meet) the criteria for useful feedback outlined in this chapter?
