## Discussion Questions

  

### _How Learning Works_: 
#### Foreword

1. “How Learning Works” is presented as a solution to the “too soft/too hard” problem. What experience have you had with sources that are too soft or too hard as you develop your teaching practices?
    
2. Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry workshop materials are also meant to fall in the Goldilock’s zone between “too soft” and “too hard”. What would it look like if they were “too soft”? What if they were “too hard”?
    
 

#### About the Authors

3.  What disciplinary backgrounds do the authors come from? What are their research interests? How might their backgrounds and research interests shape their writing?
    

  

#### Introduction

4.  This book is organized around seven principles for teaching. Discuss an example of how you’ve seen one of these principles influence learners’ experience. Try to think of an example that involves a Carpentry workshop if you can.
    
5.  The authors state that these seven principles are “domain-independent”, “experience-independent” and “cross-culturally relevant”. As we work through the readings, think about how these principles apply in instructor training workshops and standard Carpentry workshops.
    

  

#### Chapter 1: How Does Students’ Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

6.  Give an example of a time you were teaching and a learner’s prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Was their knowledge inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate?
    
7.  Which of the strategies/methods discussed for addressing prior knowledge might be useful in a situation like this?
    
8.  \*\* Where are places in our workshop curriculum where learners might be hindered by inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate knowledge?
    


### Instructor Training Curriculum
#### [Welcome](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/01-welcome/)

9.  This module includes an activity for assessing trainee’s background. What information might this give us related to trainee’s prior knowledge? How could we use this information to adjust our teaching?
    

  

#### [How Learning Works: The Importance of Practice](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/) 

10.  Identify one thing each that you’re a novice for, a competent practitioner for and an expert at. Be explicit about why you categorize yourself that way. What would need to be different about your abilities and/or knowledge in order to categorize yourself at a different level for that skill?
    
11.  We’ll talk more about mental models next week in connection with Chapter 2.
    
12.  We teach our instructors how to write good MCQs, faded examples and Parson’s problems, but most of the time we don’t use these in workshops. What sorts of formative assessments do we use instead and why? Why do you think these other types of assessment are included in the curriculum?
    

  

\*\* Suggested topic for PRs to workshop or IT curriculum.
