## Discussion Questions

1\. What questions do you have about being a Trainer?

### _How Learning Works_: 
#### Foreword

2\. _How Learning Works_ is presented as a solution to the “too soft/too hard” problem. What experience have you had with sources that are too soft or too hard, particularly with regard to teaching?
    
3\. Carpentries workshop materials are also meant to fall in the Goldilock’s zone between “too soft” and “too hard”. What would it look like if they were “too soft”? What if they were “too hard”?
    
 
#### About the Authors

4\. How might the backgrounds and research interests of the authors shape their writing?
  

#### Introduction

5\.  This book is organized around seven principles for teaching. Discuss an example of how you’ve seen one of these principles influence learners’ experience. If you can, try to think of an example from a Carpentries workshop.
    
6\.  The authors state that these seven principles are “domain-independent”, “experience-independent” and “cross-culturally relevant”. As we work through the readings, we will be discussing how to apply these principles to teaching about how to teach (in an instructor training workshop) as well as teaching computational skills (in a Carpentries workshop). We'll even talk a bit about YOUR process of learning how to teach teaching! In what ways are these 'layers' of instruction different from each other? In what ways are they the same?
    

#### Chapter 1: How Does Students’ Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

7\.  Give an example of a time you were teaching and a learner’s prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Was their knowledge inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate?
    
8\.  Which of the strategies/methods discussed for addressing prior knowledge might be useful in a situation like this?
