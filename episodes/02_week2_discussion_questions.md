## Reading
_How Learning Works_: Chapter 2, Appendix A, Appendix B, Chapter 3

## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have. 

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

2\. Examine Figure 2.2 on p.50. How do these diagrams relate to knowledge or learner mental models that you are familiar with? Which do you think best represents the knowledge structure of a learner who has just taken a Carpentries workshop? How about an Instructor Training workshop?

3\. Identify one thing that Carpentries instructors can do in a workshop to help learners organize their knowledge. Does your strategy align with any of the suggestions on p. 59-65? How easy would it be for a new instructor to employ this strategy?

#### Appendix A
4\. What is one self-assessment question you would like to see learners answer before attending an instructor training workshop? How would you use their answers? Would you use the same question before a computational workshop?

#### Appendix B
5\. Draft a small concept map (~5ish items with labeled relationships) that partially explains one of the following topics:

* Prior knowledge
* Knowledge organization
* Workshop organization
* Motivation

#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

6\. This chapter is important, but it has a lot of jargon describing closely related concepts that can make a reader feel a little lost. Can you summarize the most important points in a sentence or two, using words that non-experts could understand?

7\. Do you think learners at Carpentries computational workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? Will they primarily be placing an attainment value, intrinsic value or instrumental value on learning the material? How about trainees at instructor training workshops?

8\. Pages 83-89 offer a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies. Pick one of these and explain how it is relevant to Carpentries workshops. Are any of them **not** relevant to workshops? Why not?
