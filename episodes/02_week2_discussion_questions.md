## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this weekâ€™s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, or  questions that you have.

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

2\. Helping novices build useful mental models is a core goal of our workshops and is emphasized in instructor training. 
What are strategies that instructors could (or do) use in workshops to help learners organize their knowledge?

#### Appendix A
3\. What is one self-assessment question you would like to see learners answer before attending an instructor training workshop? How would you use their answers? Would you use the same question before a computational workshop?

#### Choose _one_ of these:
#### Appendix B
4\. Draft a small concept map for one of the following pedagogical concepts:

* Assessment
* Motivation
* Memory
* Knowledge organization

#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

5\. This chapter has a lot of jargon. How would you summarize the main take away points in a sentence or two in a way that non-experts could understand?

6\. Do you think learners at our workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? Will they primarily be placing an attainment value, intrinsic value or instrumental value on learning the material? Is this also true of trainees at instructor training workshops?

7\. Pages 83-89 offer a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies. Pick one of these and explain how it is relevant to our workshop model? Are any of them not relevant in our workshops? Why not?
