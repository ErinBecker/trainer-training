## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? This might be key points, things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have from each chapter.

- Chapter 2
- Chapter 3

### _How Learning Works_

#### Chapter 1: How Does Students’ Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

2\.  Give an example of a time from your experience when a learner’s prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Was 
their knowledge inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate? Would any of the strategies suggested in this chapter 
have applied well in this situation?
    
#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

3\. Examine Figure 2.2 (p.50 of the print edition). How do these diagrams relate to knowledge or learner mental models that 
you are familiar with? Which do you think best represents a learner who has just taken a Carpentries technical workshop? 

4\. Identify one thing that Carpentries Instructors can do in a workshop to help learners organize their knowledge. Does 
your idea align with any of the strategies listed at the end of the chapter (p. 59-65)? On a scale of 1-10, how challenging 
do you think it would be for a new Instructor to employ this strategy?

#### Appendix A
5\. Have a look at the [pre-assessment survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=pRLWB3SiycOkcDiF9r3UP5tGr2zOHWJy_2BRNgUdCAjNuIlHUEY1KC2IWSB2dl2tqg) for Instructor Training workshops. How might you use the responses of this survey? If you could ask one additional question, what would it be?

#### Appendix B
6\. **Please have some plain paper and a dark-colored marker handy during discussion in case we get to work on this question.** Draft a small concept map (3-5 items with labeled connections) that partially explains one of the following topics:

* Prior knowledge
* Knowledge organization
* Workshop organization
* Motivation

#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

7\. Take a moment with Figure 3.2 (p.80). Can you think of an situation you've encountered in a classroom that is explained 
by this figure?

8\. Do you think learners at Carpentries technical workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? How about at Instructor Training workshops?

9\. This chapte offers a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies (p.83-89). Which are most relevant to Carpentries workshops? Are any of them **not** relevant in this setting? Why or why not?
