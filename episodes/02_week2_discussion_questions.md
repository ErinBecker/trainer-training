# Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 2
## Discussion Questions

1. What do you remember most from this week’s reading, either from the book or from the curriculum? You may comment on something that particularly resonated with you, or something you had a question about.  

### _How Learning Works_
#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

2. Helping novices build useful mental models is a core goal of our workshops and is emphasized in instructor training. 
What are strategies that instructors could (or do) use in workshops to help learners organize their knowledge?

3. Where are places in our curriculum where we make connections among concepts and facts explicit? Where are places where we
could be more explicit?

4. Where are places in our curriculum where we help learners develop the ability to use fluid representations of the material 
taught? Where are places where we could do this better?

### _Instructor Training Curriculum_
#### [How Learning Works: Expertise and Instruction](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/03-expertise/)
5. This episode includes material about dismissive language. This is a common issue for instructors, 
new or experienced. What other examples can you give of dismissive language and how can we help our instructors avoid them?

#### [How Learning Works: Working Memory and Cognitive Load](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/)
6. This episode provides reasons why we go slowly and allow emphasize practice. However, instructors are often faced with the urge to go faster or cover more. How can we help instructors understand the importance of keeping it slow and resisting the urge to “cover” more material?

7. Look at one page from a Software or Data Carpentry lesson. What pre-knowledge is absolutely required to learn the content? 
Is there anything extraneous? Anything missing? How effectively does this lesson manage the learners’ cognitive load?

### _How Learning Works_
#### Choose _one_ of these:
#### Appendix B
8. Start a draft concept map for one of the following pedagogical concepts. Think about how this process helps you organize how you will teach this concept to instructor trainees.
* Assessment
* Motivation
* Memory
* Knowledge organization
#### Appendix A
9. Write a sample self-assessment for one of the Software or Data Carpentry lessons. How would an instructor use the results of this self-assessment? Be specific.
