## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? This might be key points, things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have from each chapter.

1.  Give an example of a time from your experience when a learner's prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Why do you think prior knowledge had
such an impact in this case? Do you think any of the strategies suggested in this chapter might have helped?

1. Have a look at the [pre-assessment survey](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment-archives/instructor-training-pre/instructor-training-pre.html) for
Instructor Training events. Can you identify one question that might influence how you approach teaching, depending on the distribution of responses? If you
could ask one additional question, what would it be?

1. Draft a small concept map (3-5 items with labeled connections) for **your own eyes only (not to be shared!)** that partially explains one of the following topics:

- Prior knowledge
- Knowledge organization
- Workshop organization

Then, share your experience with the process. Did you learn anything from making this map? How could you organize it differently if you tried it again?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Prior knowledge about teaching strategies varies among trainees in Instructor Training courses. Being attentive to this will improve your impact.
- Pre-assessment surveys are a critical component of all Carpentries workshops. Help us make them useful for you!
- Carpentries curriculum templates provide some support for knowledge organization. Instructors can implement additional strategies to help learners create useful connections.
- Concept maps are a challenging, minimally structured task. They are useful for exploring concepts and relationships prior to teaching because they can make the organization of knowledge more explicit.
