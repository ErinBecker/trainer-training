_How Learning Works_: Chapter 2, Appendix A, Appendix B, Chapter 3

## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have. 

### _How Learning Works_
2\. Review: What prior knowledge do you bring to bear for this training? Think of one thing you have learned about teaching through your own experience that you think is important or valuable. In what areas do you hope to expand your knowledge as an Instructor Trainer?

#### Chapter 1: How Does Students’ Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

7\.  Give an example of a time you were teaching and a learner’s prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Was their knowledge inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate? Would any of the strategies suggested in this chapter have applied well in this situation?
    

#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

3\. Examine Figure 2.2 on p.50. How do these diagrams relate to knowledge or learner mental models that you are familiar with? Which do you think best represents a learner who has just taken a Carpentries workshop? 

4\. Identify one thing that Carpentries instructors can do in a workshop to help learners organize their knowledge. Does your strategy align with any of the suggestions on p. 59-65? How easy would it be for a new instructor to employ this strategy?

#### Appendix A
5\. Have a look at the [pre-assessment survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=pRLWB3SiycOkcDiF9r3UP5tGr2zOHWJy_2BRNgUdCAjNuIlHUEY1KC2IWSB2dl2tqg) for Instructor Training workshops. How might you use the responses of this survey? If you could ask one additional question, what would it be?

#### Appendix B
6\. **Please have some plain paper and a dark-colored marker handy during discussion in case we get to work on this question.** Draft a small concept map (3-5 items with labeled connections) that partially explains one of the following topics:

* Prior knowledge
* Knowledge organization
* Workshop organization
* Motivation

#### Chapter 3: What Factors Motivate Students to Learn?

7\. This chapter is important, but it has a lot of jargon describing closely related concepts that can make a reader feel a little lost. Can you summarize the most important points in a sentence or two, using words that non-experts could understand?

8\. Do you think learners at Carpentries computational workshops will have primarily learning goals or performance goals? How about trainees at instructor training workshops?

9\. Pages 83-89 offer a number of strategies for establishing value and building positive expectancies. Pick one of these and explain how it is relevant to Carpentries workshops. Are any of them **not** relevant to workshops? Why not?
