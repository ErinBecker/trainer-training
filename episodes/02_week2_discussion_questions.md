## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? This might be key points, things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have from each chapter.
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2

### _How Learning Works_

#### Chapter 1: How Does Students’ Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

2\.  Give an example of a time from your experience when a learner’s prior knowledge negatively affected their learning. Was 
their knowledge inactive, insufficient, inappropriate or inaccurate? Would any of the strategies suggested in this chapter 
have applied well in this situation?
    
#### Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning

3\. Examine Figure 2.2 (p.50 of the print edition). How do these diagrams relate to knowledge or learner mental models that 
you are familiar with? Which do you think best represents a learner who has just taken a Carpentries technical workshop? 

4\. Identify one thing that Carpentries Instructors can do in a workshop to help learners organize their knowledge. Does 
your idea align with any of the strategies listed at the end of the chapter (p. 59-65)? On a scale of 1-10, how challenging 
do you think it would be for a new Instructor to employ this strategy?

#### Appendix A
5\. Have a look at the [pre-assessment survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=pRLWB3SiycOkcDiF9r3UP5tGr2zOHWJy_2BRNgUdCAjNuIlHUEY1KC2IWSB2dl2tqg) for Instructor Training workshops. How might you use the responses of this survey? If you could ask one additional question, what would it be?

#### Appendix B
6\. \* Draft a small concept map (3-5 items with labeled connections) for **your own eyes only (not to be shared!)** that partially explains one of the following topics:

* Prior knowledge
* Knowledge organization
* Workshop organization
* Motivation

Then, share your experience with the process. Did you learn anything from making this map? How could you organise it differently if you tried it again?
