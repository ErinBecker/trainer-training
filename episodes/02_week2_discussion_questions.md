### Trainer Training Book Club - Meeting 2
Discussion Questions

“How Learning Works”
Chapter 2: How Does the Way Students Organize Knowledge Affect Their Learning
Helping novices build useful mental models is a core goal of our workshops and is emphasized in instructor training. 
What are strategies that instructors could (or do) use in workshops to help learners organize their knowledge?

Where are places in our curriculum where we make connections among concepts and facts explicit? Where are places where we
could be more explicit?

Where are places in our curriculum where we help learners develop the ability to use fluid representations of the material 
taught? Where are places where we could do this better?

Instructor Training Curriculum
Expertise and Memory
This episode includes material about dismissive language (“The J Word”). This is a common issue for instructors,

“Seven Plus or Minus Two” lays out the rationale for both going slowly and allowing lots of opportunities for practice. 
How can we help instructors understand the importance of these two teaching strategies?

Cognitive Load
Look at one page from a Software or Data Carpentry lesson. What pre-knowledge is absolutely required to learn the content? 
Is there anything extraneous? Anything that should be included but isn’t?
